// Running Sum for Loop.

// Imagine you are a math teacher and one of your students, Maria, is struggling with understanding how to find the running sum of a series of integers. You decide to give her a problem to work on as practice.
// The problem is as follows: Maria will be given a series of n integers as input, she has to print the sum after she take input of an integer each time.
// For example, if the series of integers is 3, 4, 5, 6 the output should be 3, 7, 12, 18
// Maria is a little bit confused at first, but with your guidance and some careful practice, she is eventually able to understand and solve the problem successfully.
// NOTE: Initially the sum is zero.

// Input Format:
// For each test case, You will get the value n as an integer input in the first line, and n integers as intger input in different lines.

// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 2^10
// -2^31 <= Each integer input <= 2^31 - 1
  
// Output Format:
// Print the running sum, each time in a different line.You will be given a number n of integer data-type.

// Sample Input 0:
// 5
// 1 2 3 4 5
  
// Sample Output 0:
// 1 3 6 10 15
  
// Explanation 0:
// In the first line we receive 5, means five integer inputs will be given as input.
// Initially before taking any integer input the sum is zero.
// When we take in the first integer input which is 3, sum becomes 3.
// When we take in the second integer input which is 2, sum becomes 5.
// After 3rd input, sum becomes 7.
// After 4th input, sum becomes 6,
// After 5th input, sum becomes 10.
